## Planning

Before generating a figma drawing that looks like this ("public./leve-up-math's-skills.pnp", then "public./leve-up-math's-skills(1).pnp") or(https://www.figma.com/file/1vnDPX1jWobP4jIir0aliz/First-demo-project?node-id=507%3A2), I first sketch out the concept on a whiteboard and identify the different boxes with their appropriate functions. I then choose the framework react, typescript with vite. In order to improve the responsive layout, I also used Bootstrap.

Finally, I made the decision to use an IndexedDB database to gather student (the user) responses when they submit their answers to track their progress and keep data on a browser side database so that even if the browser or the tab were to close, it would still render when the app opened again.
